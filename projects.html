                        <h1>Automated Infant Monitoring System (IoT)</h1>
                        <p>In 2018, I developed an IoT-based Automated Infant Monitoring System designed to track infants' vital signs and environmental conditions in real time. The system utilized sensors to continuously monitor key health indicators such as heart rate, body temperature, and respiration, as well as external factors like room temperature and humidity. This data was transmitted to a cloud-based platform where caregivers could access real-time updates and receive alerts in case of abnormal readings.
                            The system aimed to enhance infant safety by providing timely information and early warning notifications, allowing for prompt intervention when necessary.</p>

                        <h1>Plant Monitoring System and Application (IoT and Android Studio)</h1>
                        <p>In 2019, I developed a Plant Monitoring System and Application using IoT and Android Studio to provide continuous monitoring of plant health. 
                            The system utilized sensors to track key environmental factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and light levels, with data transmitted to an Android app in real time. 
                            The application provided users with care recommendations based on the data, offering insights for optimal plant growth and health. This solution aimed to make plant care more efficient and informed, empowering users to maintain ideal conditions for their plants.</p>
